                    <p>Accessibility is usually thought of as something you do for users with disabilities. True, but not the whole truth. ADVANCE FRAGMENT. Accessibility means that people on slow connections, such as crappy cell phone wifi or in rural areas where broadband isn't available, when images time out loading, have an easier time using your website. It means that if an image gets deleted from the server but it's still being linked in your content, there's a fallback. ADVANCE FRAGMENT. It gives search engines an easy way to provide information to <em>their</em> users, and we all want to make life easier for The Great God Google.</p>
                    <p>ADVANCE FRAGMENT. When we talk about federal standards for web accessibility, we're usually referring to section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, ยง1194.22. Columbia University is a private university subject to Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act and it receives federal financial assistance &mdash; such as federal research grants and student financial aid &mdash; and is, therefore, subject to Section 508. Institutions such as Harvard and Northwestern have had to deal with the Department of Justice and organizations advocating for disabled users over alleged violations of Section 508 &mdash; let's just avoid the whole unpleasantness and do the right thing from the start.</p>

                      <p>The best way to ensure that images are accessible is using an alt tag. You can enhance this technique with additional things like captions, but captions are not enough on their own.</p>
                        <p>[Alt key + alt HTML]</p>
                        <p>Most of the time, if you're dealing with a rich text editor, there will be a easy textbox provided for your use, so content editors won't have to worry about the HTML. Let's take a look at that.</p>

                <h2>But what do I write?</h2>
                <p>Think about the <em>content</em> and <em>function</em> of your image.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Is the image decorative or informative?</li>
                    <li>Is there text in the image?</li>
                        <li>Does the image link somewhere?</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes"><p>These are the first questions you should ask when you're creating alternative text for an image. The answers to these will point you in the right direction for your next steps.</p>
                </aside>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Decorative or informative?</h2>
                <p><strong>Decorative</strong>:</p><p>pretty! conveys no information! Use empty alt text.</p>
                <p><strong>Informative</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Picture: provide a name or a short description</li>
                    <li>Text: reproduce the text word for word</li>
                    <li>Data: provide an overview</li>
                    <li>Functional: emphasize action</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">
                <p>Decorative images should not be in your HTML. Move them to CSS if at all possible. If you can't do that, provide an alt tag without any text. I know this is counter-intuitive, but trust me.</p>
                    <p>Pictures: coming up in a moment. Text: Don't do this. If you have an image with text, take the image out and put the text in your written content. If you <em>must</em> have an image with text (MARKETING), duplicate the text in its entirety in your alternative text. If you have data, like a graph or chart, summarize the information that the data is providing. In most cases, an image will only have a function if it is contained within a link.</p>

                        <p>Because of his role as the Commander in Chief of American forces in the Revolutionary War, and, later, the first President of the United States, George Washington is often called the "Father of his Country".</p>

                        <li>"Image of George Washington"</li>
                        <li>"George Washington, the first president of the United States"</li>
                        <li>An empty alt tag is fine.</li>
                        <li>"George Washington"</li>
                    </ol>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p>Informative pictures! Images with content! Whatever you call them, they are the complicated, common, interesting problem of alternative text. And there may not be an easy answer. First principles: </p>
                        <p>The <code>alt</code> text for a picture should:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Be succinct.</strong> Typically no more than a few words are necessary, though rarely a short sentence or two may be appropriate. One of the most common screen readers, JAWS, break text into 125-character chunks.</li>
                            <li><strong>NOT be redundant</strong> or provide the same information as text within the context of the image.</li>
                            <li><strong>NOT use the phrases "image of ..." or "photo of ..." to describe the image.</strong> It's usually apparent to the user that it is an image. And if the image is conveying content, it is typically not necessary that the user know that it is an image that is conveying the content, as opposed to text. If the fact that an image is a photograph or illustration is important content, it may be useful to include this in alternative text.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>ADVANCE FRAGMENT. Ten seconds for audience to think about what they would use for alt text. ADVANCE FRAGMENT. Let's go through these options and discuss what's right and wrong about them. #1 shouldn't have the words "Image of", so we can reject that option. #2 is redundant, providing information that is already available in the context, so throw that out. #3 isn't right because this image isn't purely decorative; it does provide information to the visual user that needs to be available to everyone. So we're left with #4, which can probably be improved, but does concisely name the image and isn't redundant.</p>

                    <h2>Example 2</h2>
                    <div class="example">
                        <img src="img/access-george.jpg" alt="example image"><span class="caption">George Washington</span>
                        <p>Because of his role as the Commander in Chief of American forces in the Revolutionary War, and, later, the first President of the United States, George Washington is often called the "Father of his Country".</p>

                    <p>What would be appropriate alternative text for this image?</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>"George Washington"</li>
                        <li>An empty alt tag is fine.</li>
                        <li>"Image"</li>
                        <li>The image does not need an alt tag.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p>In this case, the content of the image is presented within the surrounding content, so #2, empty alt text, is the best one of the choices. #1 would be redundant, because of the caption. #3 provides extraneous and useless information. #4 is never the right choice &mdash; every image must have an alt attribute.</p>

                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington"><img src="img/access-george.jpg" alt="example image"></a><span class="caption"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington">George Washington</a></span>
                        <p>Because of his role as the Commander in Chief of American forces in the Revolutionary War, and, later, the first President of the United States, George Washington is often called the "Father of his Country".</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>What would be appropriate alternative text for this image?</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>An empty alt attribute (alt="") will suffice.</li>
                        <li>"Wikipedia entry for George Washington"</li>
                        <li>"Read More"</li>
                        <li>"George Washington"</li>
                    </ol>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        <p>In this case, the image is also a link, so it has a function. Whenever an image is within a link, the function of the image must be presented in alternative text that is also within the link. In this case, there is no adjacent text within the link that describes the function, so it must be presented within the alt attribute. As a result, #4 ("George Washington") is likely the best choice. While the words "George Washington" in the alt attribute are redundant with the text that follows, in this case the redundancy is necessary to adequately describe the function.</p>
                        <p>#1 is not adequate. An image that is the only thing inside a link must never have a missing or empty alt attribute. This is because the screen reader must read SOMETHING to identify the link. Screen readers might read the image file name or the URL of the page being linked to, which may or may not be useful. And remember, that the link may be read out of context of the surrounding text, such as when the user is navigating by links within the page. #2 provides content that is not available through the image alone (i.e., you can't tell the image links to Wikipedia simply by looking at it). #3 does not provide an adequate description of the function, especially out of context.</p>
                        <p>When possible, avoid using "link to..." or "click this image to..." or similar wording in the alt attribute. Links are identified as links by screen readers and should be visually apparent to sighted users.</p>

                    </ol>
                    <aside class="notes"><p>This one is legitimately hard, especially since we don't have a realistic context for this tiny excerpt. But we can try!</p><p>#1 isn't really enough; the part where George Washington is a figure in the painting may not be the point. #2 isn't terrible, because it may be useful to know that the image is of a painting instead of a photograph, so let's not reject it right away. #3 has some information that may help the user to identify the image from another context, since I remind you that alternative text isn't just for the blind. #4 might work if the image is being used to illustrate a discussion of a specific artistic technique and the image's subject isn't the point. #5 would only be a good choice if the context of the image were a detailed examination of the painting, but it shouldn't be alternative text, it should be part of the page's text content.</p><p>So there isn't one right answer. There are better and worse solutions, depending on context and how the image is being used within that context.</aside>
